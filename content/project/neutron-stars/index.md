The densest objects in the universe supported by nuclear forces. Much is still unknown about the properties of the cores of these extreme stars.

Much of my research focuses on techniques to understand the thermodynamic properties (such as the equation of state) of state of neutron-star matter. Specifically I have worked to synthesize inputs from astrophysics, nuclear theory, and particle theory to shed light on the behavior of the matter within the cores of the most massive neutron stars. 

Recently I have also begun to explore transport properties of cold and dense matter, which are more sensitive to the degrees of freedom than thermodynamic properties are.
