abstract: The equation of state of QCD matter at high densities is relevant for neutron star structure and for neutron star mergers and has been a focus of recent work.  We show how lattice QCD simulations, free of sign problems, can provide an *upper bound* on the pressure as a function of quark chemical potentials.  We show that at large chemical potentials this bound should become quite sharp; the difference between the upper bound on the pressure <math>$P_\mathrm{PQ}$</math> and the true pressure <math>$P$</math> is of order <math>$P_\mathrm{PQ}-P = O(\alpha_s^3 P)$</math>.  The corrections arise from a single Feynman diagram; its calculation would render remaining corrections <math>$O(\alpha_s^4 P)$</math>.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "
We show that the pressure of phase-quenched QCD -- a theory that is simpler to compute on the lattice -- agrees with the pressure of true QCD up to next-to-next-to-next to leading order, where it differes in only one part of one diagram (pictured).
