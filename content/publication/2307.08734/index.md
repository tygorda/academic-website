abstract: Accurately understanding the equation of state (EOS) of high-density, zero-temperature quark matter plays an essential role in constraining the behavior of dense strongly interacting matter inside the cores of neutron stars. In this Letter, we study the weak-coupling expansion of the EOS of cold quark matter and derive the complete, gauge-invariant contributions from the long-wavelength, dynamically screened gluonic sector at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$​. This elevates the EOS result to the $O(\alpha_s^3 \,\mathrm{ln}\, \alpha_s​)$ level, leaving only one unknown constant from the unscreened sector at N3LO, and places it on par with its high-temperature counterpart from 2003.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "
We calculate the state-of-the-art pressure of cold and dense deconfined matter by accounting for the physics from all of the long-wavelength, dynamically screened gluons at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order.
