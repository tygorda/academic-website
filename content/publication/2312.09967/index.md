abstract: Does deconfined cold quark matter occur in nature? This is currently one of the fundamental open questions in nuclear astrophysics. In these proceedings, I review the current state-of-the-art techniques to address this question in a model-agnostic manner, by synthesizing inputs from astrophysical observations of neutron stars and their binary mergers, and first-principles calculations within nuclear and particle theory. I highlight recent improvements in perturbative calculations in asymptotically dense cold quark matter, as well as compelling evidence for a conformalizing transition within the cores of massive neutron stars.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
